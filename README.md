# 🧸 Toy Store Sales Dashboard - Power BI Project

This Power BI dashboard visualizes and analyzes sales performance for a fictional toy store. It showcases the ability to transform raw CSV data into meaningful business insights using data modeling, cleaning, and interactive reporting.

- 💰 **Product Pricing & Costs** — Visual analysis of pricing strategy.
- 📈 **Sales Trends** — Monthly revenue, cost, and profit tracking.
- 🏆 **Top-Selling Products** — Rankings by quantity and revenue.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**

- Converted text to numeric types (Currency).
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Built a data model for easy filtering and slicers.
